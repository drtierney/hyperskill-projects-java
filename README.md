**Stage #1 Hello! What’s your name?**
Teach your assistant to introduce itself in the console

**Stage #2: How old are you?**
Use your knowledge of strings and numbers to make the assistant guess your age

**Stage #3: Let’s count!**
Your assistant is old enough to learn how to count. And you are experienced enough to apply the for-loop at this stage!

**Stage #4: The student and the teacher**
At this point, the assistant will be able to check your knowledge and ask multiple choice questions. 
Add some methods to your code and make the stage even better

**Stage #1 Hello, coffee!**
Write a program that puts basic information on the screen: give the machine a chance to tell the customers what it’s doing!

**Stage #2 Machines have needs**
Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.

**Stage #3 Enough coffee for everyone**
Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.

**Stage #4 Action!**
Upgrade your knowledge of methods - set the machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.

**Stage #5 On a coffee loop**
Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you press exit.

**Stage #6 Brush your code**
Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.
